# AWS IAM
## AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Definition
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their permissions to AWS resources.

### Use cases
#### Multi-Factor Authentication
AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they are prompted for their user name and password (the first factor—what they know), as well as for an authentication code from their virtual MFA device (the second factor—what they have). Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources.

You can enable MFA for your AWS account and for individual IAM users you have created under your account. MFA can be also be used to control access to AWS service APIs.

#### Virtual MFA Apps
You can install apps on your smartphone from the app store that is specific to your phone type. The following list shows some apps for different smartphone types:
